# Optimized-Bitonic-Sorter-Design-in-System-Verilog

Our team designed and implemented an efficient, low-cost, and high-performance bitonic sorter using System Verilog at the RTL level. This specialized parallel sorting algorithm effectively organizes sequences of numbers by dividing them into bitonic sequences and comparing elements in either ascending or descending order. Our implementation achieved O(logÂ²n) time complexity while optimizing hardware resources. We significantly reduced the required comparison units from 32 to just 8, leading to substantial improvements in logic utilization, area requirements, and power consumption. This optimization also shortened critical path delays, enabling the sorter to operate at higher clock frequencies. The architecture combines registers, multiplexers, parallel comparators, state machines, and counters in a carefully designed datapath-control unit structure. Extensive simulations in Quartus Prime validated the design's correctness and efficiency across various input sequences. The modular design approach allows for potential future enhancements, including serial comparison implementations for further optimization or VLSI chip production for even greater performance.
